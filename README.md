# youtube-insert-into-playlist-with-delay

## Work in progress

**What is this used for?**

This application allows you to add YouTube videos to one of your playlists with after a delay of 2 hours.

This is used in conjunction with a website blocker (such as ColdTurkey). In most website blockers you can block the domain youtube.com and create an exception for a playlist. Once a video has been added to this playlist, you can then access this video via the playlist.

**Why is there a delay before the video is added?**

This 2-hour delay eliminates the impulsivity of watching YouTube videos by interrupting the immediate gratification loop. By the time the video becomes accessible, the initial urge to watch it has often subsided, allowing you to make a more deliberate decision about whether it's worth your time.
